## Demo 2 Components:
- DMA1 channel 4
- DAC1 channel 2
- GPIO port A pin 5
- TIM6

## Demo 2 Workflow:
1. **TIM6** generates an update event when its counter overflows (every 50 ms).
2. The update event will trigger the data to be transferred from **DAC1 channel 2** *12-bit right-aligned data holding register* (`DAC_DHR12R2`) to **DAC1 channel 2** *data output register* (`DAC_DOR2`).
3. A DMA request is generated by **DAC1 channel 2** and a 16-bit data is transferred from `wave` (an array of 16-bit unsigned integers representing waveform data) to `DAC_DHR12R2` via **DMA1 channel 4**.
4. **DAC1 channel 2** outputs analog voltage to the green LED via **GPIO port A pin 5**.
